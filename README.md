# aai-selfdriving-cars
The goal of this Project  is to create a rudimentary AI System to identify different street situations form a driver point of view.
To achieve it, we analyze a picture with the yolov8n model to approximate a realtime application (disclaimer: it is not a realtime system).
For specific objects like traffic lights and traffic signs we use the detected position of these to classify the exact class of this category.

## The Architecture 

## Dataset 
To fine tune the yolov8n model we download training pictures with the src/download_images.py script.
After that we label this pictures with the website https://www.makesense.ai/



# The YOLO v8
Yolo (You only look once) is an Deep Learning Model for computer vision tasks (e.g object detection, segmentation)

## YOLO v8 pretrained  models
There are 6 pretrained models available which just differs in size (of Parameters) and runtime.
They got trained at the COCO dataset and cover 79 categories:
0: 'person', 1: 'bicycle', 2: 'car', 3: 'motorcycle', 4: 'airplane', 5: 'bus', 6: 'train', 7: 'truck', 8: 'boat', 9: 'traffic light', 
10: 'fire hydrant', 11: 'stop sign', 12: 'parking meter', 13: 'bench', 14: 'bird', 15: 'cat', 16: 'dog', 17: 'horse', 18: 'sheep', 19: 'cow', 
20: 'elephant', 21: 'bear', 22: 'zebra', 23: 'giraffe', 24: 'backpack', 25: 'umbrella', 26: 'handbag', 27: 'tie', 28: 'suitcase', 29: 'frisbee', 
30: 'skis', 31: 'snowboard', 32: 'sports ball', 33: 'kite', 34: 'baseball bat', 35: 'baseball glove', 36: 'skateboard', 37: 'surfboard', 38: 'tennis racket', 39: 'bottle', 
40: 'wine glass', 41: 'cup', 42: 'fork', 43: 'knife', 44: 'spoon', 45: 'bowl', 46: 'banana', 47: 'apple', 48: 'sandwich', 49: 'orange', 
50: 'broccoli', 51: 'carrot', 52: 'hot dog', 53: 'pizza', 54: 'donut', 55: 'cake', 56: 'chair', 57: 'couch', 58: 'potted plant', 59: 'bed', 
60: 'dining table', 61: 'toilet', 62: 'tv', 63: 'laptop', 64: 'mouse', 65: 'remote', 66: 'keyboard', 67: 'cell phone', 68: 'microwave', 69: 'oven', 
70: 'toaster', 71: 'sink', 72: 'refrigerator', 73: 'book', 74: 'clock', 75: 'vase', 76: 'scissors', 77: 'teddy bear', 78: 'hair drier', 79: 'toothbrush'

# our way of "fine tuning"
In order to be more precised for object classification with the pretrained yolo model (for example: is the detected traffic light green or red).
We decided to detect the object with the default yolo model and use the information of the position to create a new image which just get classified.
For classification we tried to create our own classificator. 
We implement just a proof of concept for traffic lights and traffic signs!

## problems with this approach
### the dataset
### the extracted image form original road scene
* traffic lights detected from yolo may have no light, e.g. if the traffic sign shows away from the camera
    the classificator is then every time wrong because of the training data set

* the image is very small so we added a summand corresponding to the boxing size

## Information about Data Sets
Here are some use full Information about creating own datasets.
We can use these information to create a data set for our own purpose.
The structure of the dataset, described here, amies a uncomplicated way to train YOLOv8 models.

### Folder structure

./"Name" dataset
    images/
        test
        train
        valid

### Data Tips and Tricks
* 20% valid - 80% train data or 30% - 70% 
* ensure a good diversity and variance (no sequences a video clip as frames, because there are heavily correlated)
* to care of luminosity and different angles much more data have to be used
* no overlapping between training and validation data
* amount of data for different classes should be balanced (200 car pictures, 200 truck pictures)
